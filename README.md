# Matlab-Machine-Learning
Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms for flake analysis. 

The initial idea for this project was to help the grad student I was working with at UTD in the analysis of flake materials created by standard exfoliation methods. Finding the right thickness to study its electrical properties is of huge importance. Unfortunately due to how light travels through substrate, and material flake layers its not so simple. In fact it's pretty complex, many supervised models exist that acheive use gigs of training data and are often complex to operate. The idea then was to use simple clustering algorithms with reference photos in similar lighting conditions to acheive the same result. For which I've compared several of these aglorithms in MATLAB. Overall its a pretty simple idea, but I think in the right conditions it could be pretty powerful.

All unsupervised algorithms are specified as U_name.m and the only real change you have to make is the file name.
